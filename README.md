Hacktoberfest, organized by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and other sponsors, is a month-long celebration of open-source software that takes place every October. The event aims to motivate developers, newbies and veterans alike, to contribute to open-source projects. Participants can win swag, like T-shirts and stickers, by making a certain number of pull requests to open-source projects on GitHub during the month. It's a fantastic opportunity not only to give back to the community but also to learn and collaborate with developers from around the world. Want to start your open-source journey?
